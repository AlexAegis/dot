# TODO: Clarify

# This file containes modules that can't be present when this module
# is installed.

# When installing and two clashing modules are present then ask which one to
# chose. If started with --no-interactive then just abort and print the clash.

# When installing and resolving the selection, check the final module list
# for clashes among itself. If there is any, print an error and ask for input
# Then when its executing. Each time a module with a clashlist is executed.
# Hard remove every installed, clashing module.
