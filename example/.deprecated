# If this file is present then the module is going to be ignored by dot and a
# warning will be thrown when trying to install it. (Installation still can be
# forced)

# Here you can also list alternatives, then this file will be interpreted
# as 'deprecated in favour of...'
# In this case, these will be installed instead of this

# Supports all expressions that the `dependencies` file supports

# Example:

other-arch-module ? [ $arch ]
other-void-module ? [ $void ]
+ubuntu-alternatives ?  [ $ubuntu ]

# Usually it's much simpler, and a single module is used

# Why not just delete the module instead of marking it as deprecated?
# You can, of course. But I don't delete modules for two reason:
# - To keep them as reference
# - To remind me that I already tried it, and how I did it
#   Later it might get some improvements that would make me rethink it's usage
