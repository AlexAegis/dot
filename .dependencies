# This file is used by dot itself
# and these are recommended modules to use with it
# an XDG module which provides XDG locations of your choice
# This is where dots user level symlink will be stowed to
xdg
# stow, to let itself be stowed in the first place
stow

# Neither of these are necessary to use dot, this is only used
