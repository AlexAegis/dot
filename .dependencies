# This file is used by `pont` itself
# and these are recommended modules to use with it
# an XDG module which provides XDG locations of your choice
# This is where `pont` user level symlink will be stowed to
xdg
# stow, to let itself be stowed in the first place
stow

# Neither of these are necessary to use `pont`, this is only used
# for placing a symlink to $XDG_BIN_HOME
